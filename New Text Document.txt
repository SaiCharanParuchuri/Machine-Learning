The lecture discuss different opinion on four-day workweek. Firstly, four day workweek will not increase the company's profits. In fact it may actually decrease profit's because company need to hire more employees to complete work in four day work week.
Secondly, there will not be any decrease in unemployment rates because companies look for another way to decrease the employee salaries expenditure. Lastly, having more relax time will not improve any quality of work they do because it vary from employee to employee. It also risk like they may be fired firstly when the company need to reduce the costs.


I agree with statement people benefit more from traveling in their own country than from traveling to foreign countries. From my point of view I believe that people traveling in their own country will help increase their countries tourism income and will help to understand their countries geographical and cultural difference in their country.
Travelling domestically is more easy than travelling abroad because of language barrier. The ability to speak the local language will help tourists to have more depth in traveling experience. The budget to in own country will be less when compared to travel in foreign countries.
